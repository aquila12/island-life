	Terrain
		Wastes(?)
			- Base tiles; what grasslands decay into
		Grasslands
			- Basis for everything else
			- Wastes with 2 grass adjacent will become grass
			- Need 2 adjacent grass to survive
		New Forest(?)
			- Grasslands surrounded by grasslands or better become New Forest
			- Needs 4 adjacent grassland+ to survive
		Forest
			- 
		Ancient Forest(?)
			- Forests surrounded by other forests become Ancient Forests
			- Need to be surrounded by forest to survive
			- 
		
	Wildlife
		Each tier of terrain could support an extra species in a tile (grasslands 1, new forest 2 etc.)
		
		Herbivore
			- Needs a certain tier of terrain to support advanced species
			- Provides a certain number of points to feed carnivore
				- Little animals: few points
				- Middle animals: most points
				- Big animals: fewer points
				- Could modulate the relationships between species by having power values that vary the points given by each prey
			
		Predator
			- Have a given range they can feed over
			- So long as there's enough prey in the range, they survive
			- If ranges overlap, probably just split the points equally
